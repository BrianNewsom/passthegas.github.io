## Running Tests
This code uses [Dalek](http://dalekjs.com/) for automated JS and HTML testing.  The tests are found in the test folder.  They can be run as follows.
* Install NodeJS & npm
* $ npm install dalek-cli -g
* $ npm install dalekjs --save-dev
* $ dalek test/dalekTests.js
This will start the run script and it will run all unit tests automatically! How cool!
